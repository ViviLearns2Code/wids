    "# WIDS 2018 Datathon\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for the challenge will contain demographic and behavioral information from a representative sample of survey respondents from India and their usage of traditional and mobile financial services. The dataset is a product of InterMedia’s research to help the world’s poorest people take advantage of widely available mobile phones and other digital technology to access financial tools and participate more fully in their local economies. Women in these communities, in particular, are often largely excluded from the formal financial system. By predicting gender, the datathon teams will explore the key differences in behavior patterns of men and women, and how that may impact their use of new financial services. Ideally, these findings will influence plans to reach women in developing economies and encourage them to adopt new financial tools that will help to lift them and their families out of poverty.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "The training set has 18255 entries with 1235 features.\n",
    "The test set has 27285 entries with 1234 features.\n",
    "Both datasets have the same columns except for \n",

    "All columns represent different answers to survey questions. The columns suffixed \"OTHERS\" contain answers which are not included as answering options in the respective survey question. In the respective survey question, this freestyle answer is encoded as \"96 - others\". We can therefore drop all \"OTHERS\" columns, as the information we need is already contained in the column of the respective question. The same applies to the columns \"MM12_REC\" and \"MM13_REC\", which contain freestyle answers.\n",
    "The only other text columns are LN2_RIndLngBEOth and LN2_WIndLngBEOth. Survey questions LN2_3 and LN2_4 were conducted in different languages. The language name is recorded in LN2_RIndLngBEOth and LN2_WIndLngBEOth. These specifications were also noted down in a freestyle fashion (for example, language combinations such as \"Hindi & Rajasthani\" or typos such as \"HIndi\"). We drop the columns and only use LN2_3 and LN2_4 without further specification."
